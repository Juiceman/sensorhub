This is a tutorial to help you write your first sensor driver, based on the "fake weather station" demo module that is provided with SensorHub source and binary releases.

First step is to create the maven project that will contain the new module. Follow the [steps on the wiki](https://github.com/sensiasoft/sensorhub/wiki/Adding-new-modules) to create a new Eclipse Maven project. For the sake of coherency, you should name your driver project `sensorhub-driver-{your_driver_name}`. In the case of the weather station, we name it `sensorhub-driver-fakeweather`.
